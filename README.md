Here provides the data used in the following dust-snow internal mixing manuscript (He et al., 2019, in review): "Enhanced snow absorption and albedo reduction by dust-snow internal mixing: modeling and parameterization".

It includes the data for solar spectra (clear-sky and overcast-cloud) from Flanner et al. (2007) and snow optical properties and albedo for all cases produced in this study. Please see the manuscript for details (He et al. 2019, in review)
