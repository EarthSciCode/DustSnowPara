Here provides the data used in the following dust-snow internal mixing paper (He et al., 2019, JAMES): 

He, C., K. N. Liou, Y. Takano, F. Chen, and M. Barlage (2019): Enhanced snow absorption and albedo reduction by dust-snow internal mixing: modeling and parameterization, JAMES, 11, 3755-3776, doi:10.1029/2019MS001737.

It includes the data for solar spectra (clear-sky and overcast-cloud) from Flanner et al. (2007) and snow optical properties and albedo for all cases produced in this study. Please see the paper for details (He et al. 2019, JAMES).

The data is only for educational and research purposes.

If you have any questions, please contact the corresponding author: Cenlin He (cenlinhe@ucar.edu). Thank you!
